# G-BOT


## The G-Bot Project for Discord

The Google Developer Group Galway is currently working on making a cool bot for Discord.
This project uses discord.io which is a simple wrapper for the Discord API. Info and documentation [here](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io).


## Setup

The latest versions of Node.js and npm are required in order to build and run this project.
More info on Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
More info on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/

If you want to test your local version you will have to create a [Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) to get your APP_TOKEN.
You can now replace the placeholder **"YOUR\_APP\_TOKEN"** in _app.js_ with your token.
You will also have to add your bot to a server in order to test it. You can find more information about this [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2).

### Download and install the required dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the project
```
node app.js
```


## Edit the code

Everything is in _app.js_ at the moment. The code is heavily commented, if you have any questions feel free to contact me on the GDG Galway Discord Server. @Julien_Garrigues
